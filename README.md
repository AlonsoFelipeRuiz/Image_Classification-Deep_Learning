# Image_Classification-Deep_Learning

The objective of the Project is to simulate a comprehensive analysis of an image classification problem using Deep Learning.

The analysis consists of a series of steps that we went through one by one, which can serve as a guide for you to follow when solving a problem with Deep Learning. The steps we will follow are as follows:

1. Dataset: Downloading and previewing the data.
2. Data Preprocessing: Preparing the images to be trainable.
3. Building a Model from Scratch: Creating a neural network from scratch.
4. Hyperparameter Tuning: Improving the previous model by adjusting hyperparameters.
5. Pretrained Models (Fine-Tuning): Using Fine-Tuning techniques on a pretrained model.
6. Data Augmentation (Optional): Using data augmentation on the dataset.
7. Conclusion: Drawing conclusions based on the results obtained, deciding which of the trained models could be deployed in production for use.

The model classifies dog race based on images.
